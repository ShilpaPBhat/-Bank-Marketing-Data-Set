## About

This exercise was the part of Machine Learning coursework at The University of Texas at Dallas
The goal here was to understand various machine learning classification algorithms.

## Data Description

The dataset used here is from [UCI - Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). 
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, 
in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. More info can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook]()

## Methodology
